# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Tkinter.

## Overview

This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same computer.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- Interactive GUI.
- Displays whose turn it is.
- Detects win or draw conditions and displays a message.
- Resets the board for a new game.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

Once you run the `tic_tac_toe.ipynb` script, a window will pop up with the Tic Tac Toe game. Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their marks (X or O). The game will display a message when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie. The board will reset automatically after displaying the message.
